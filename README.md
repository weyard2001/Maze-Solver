# Maze Generator and Solver
A Python application that generates and solves mazes.

## Maze Generation Algorithms
The following were implemented to generate mazes:
* Recursive Backtracking
* Recursive Division
* Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm
* Randomized Prim's Algorithm

## Maze Solving Algorithms
The following were implemented to solve generated mazes:
* Left-Hand Rule (Wall Follower)
* Breadth-First Search

## Running the application
Open a command-line and change your directory to where the project is cloned. Enter ```python main.py``` (or ```python3 main.py``` if the former does not work).

## Requirements
* Python3
* Pygame
* Tkinter
